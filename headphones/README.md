##Project Overview

This project is a from-scratch implementation of a responsive and accessible web page for a Headphone website. The goal is to recreate the provided designer layout using only HTML and CSS, without relying on any external libraries or frameworks.

The project focuses on applying core front-end fundamentals, including:

Semantic HTML

CSS styling

Accessibility best practices

Responsive web design

The final result should visually match the designer’s file while remaining fully functional across different screen sizes.

#Project Objectives

Build a complete web page without any CSS or JavaScript libraries

Ensure the layout matches the designer file as closely as possible

Apply responsive design principles

Follow accessibility standards

Maintain clean and well-structured code

#Technologies Used

HTML5 – for page structure and semantics

CSS3 – for layout, styling, and responsiveness

#Responsive Design Requirements

The web page must adapt smoothly to different screen sizes.

Mobile Version

The layout switches to the mobile version when screen width is 480px or less

Content stacks vertically for better readability

Images and text scale properly on small screens

Desktop Version

Content is centered

Maximum content width is 1000px

Layout remains consistent with the designer file

🎨 Interaction Notes

The following interactions must be implemented:

Links (hover & active):

color: #FF6565;

Buttons (hover & active):

opacity: 0.9;

Content layout:

Maximum width: 1000px

Content must be centered horizontally on the page

♿ Accessibility Guidelines

Use semantic HTML elements (<header>, <nav>, <main>, <section>, <footer>)

Provide meaningful alt attributes for images

Ensure good color contrast for readability

Use accessible font sizes

✅ Expected Outcome

By the end of this project, you should have:

A fully functional web page

A responsive design that works on desktop and mobile

Clean, readable, and maintainable HTML/CSS code

A layout that visually matches the designer’s file

📌 Notes

You are free to implement the layout in your own way as long as:

No external libraries are used

The final appearance matches the designer’s file

All interaction and responsive requirements are met
